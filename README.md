This project consists of following steps:

- Preprocess, filter and clean data from dataset
- Feature Engineering
- modelling data with following regression Algorithms
   
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - ElasticNet
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest 
   - KNN
   
R2 score, Adjusted R2 score, Mean Suqared Error are taken as Accuracy Matrices for each Algorithm and compared.
Best Algorithm is selected for final model having highest R2 score and lowest MSE.
